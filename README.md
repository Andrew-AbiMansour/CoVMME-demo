- Synopsis (this would be a short description of the data being included): molecular dynamics simulation of 3 Nωv protomers in implicit solvent 
- Full Description (if different from synopsis/relevant): the structural transition of 3 protomers of nudaurelia capensis omega virus (Nωv) capsid are studied with constant pressure molecular dynamics at low pH, starting from the experimentally determined crystal structure of the capsid protein [1], and the computational results are compared to ref [2] demonsrating that etc. etc.
