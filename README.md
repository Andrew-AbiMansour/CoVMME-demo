- Abstract (this would be a short description of the data being included): molecular dynamics simulation of COVID-19 main protease (6lu7) in complex with an inhibitor N3 in implicit solvent 
- Full Description (if different from synopsis/relevant): the structural transition of COVID-19 main protease is studied with constant pressure molecular dynamics and charmm36 forcefield, starting from the experimentally determined crystal structure of the protein [1]. The generalized Born implicit solvent (GBIS) model was used to account for the aqueous environment. The results show that etc. etc.
