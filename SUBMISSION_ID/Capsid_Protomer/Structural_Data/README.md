Preparation:
- Starting from the crystal structure of 1OHF (Initial/1ohf.rcsb.pdb), 3 protomers were constructed via symmetrical transformations [ref] and the protonated state determined based on the method outlined in [ref].
- To replicate the final structure (Final.1ohf.triangle.pdb), run the following scripts ...
