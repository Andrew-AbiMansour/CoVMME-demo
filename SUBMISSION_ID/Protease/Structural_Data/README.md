Preparation:
- List the changes made to the crystal structure of [6LU7](Initial/6lu7.rcsb.pdb), e.g. removal/addition of specific atoms/residues, that yield the [final structure](Final/6lu7.autopsf.pdb).
- Include any scripts or procedures necessary to replicate the [final structure](Final/6lu7.autopsf.pdb) e.g. run 'AutoPSF plugin' in vmd.
- Include any software package needed to run the scripts e.g. [Software](Software.md)
