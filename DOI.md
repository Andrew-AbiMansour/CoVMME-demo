## Citations

### Published work
Any dataset that is either published or associated with published work that has a [Digital Object Identifier](https://www.doi.org) (DOI) should be included and stored under the "Papers" directory. 

* Author (2020): Title. Publisher. Dataset. DOI: link_to_doi
* e.g. Yang *et tal.* (2020): The crystal structure of COVID-19 main protease in complex with an inhibitor N3. BiorRxiv. Dataset. DOI: [0.1101/2020.02.26.964882](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.964882)

### Unpublished work
If your dataset does not have a DOI, you can generate one with:

- [Figshare](https://figshare.com): 
   * Create an [account](https://figshare.com/account/register), confirm your registration with your email, and then login with your credentials.
   * Go to the home [page](https://figshare.com/account/home#/data).
   * If your dataset is hosted on github, click on "Import from Github" and select the relevant repoistory.
   * If your dataset is not hosted on github, click on "Create a new item", and fill in the fields. If your datasets are hosted elsewhere, select the "Metadata record only"; otherwise, upload your files by clicking on the upload/drag file(s) button and upload your files. 
   * Once you're done with filling all the fields, make sure to click on "Reserve Digital Object Identifier". This should produce a DOI link e.g. 10.6084/m9.figshare.12089361
   * Select "Publish" in the bottom menu, and click on "save changes".

  Example: MolSSI (2020): CoVMME-demo. Github. Dataset. DOI: [10.6084/m9.figshare.12089292](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12089292)

- [EZID](https://ezid.cdlib.org): creates identifiers for any kind of entity including physical, digital (images, data, text, etc.), abstracts, etc. EZID provides pointers to objects (e.g. datasets) stored on the web.

  * e.g. MolSSI (2020): CoVMME-demo. Github. Dataset. DOI: [10.5072/FK2X63KR95](https://doi.org/10.5072/FK2X63KR95)
  
- [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org): general-purpose open-access repository that provides data storage and DOI generation.
   * e.g. Aragao *et tal.* (2020): Raw diffraction data for structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease with PCM-0102179 (ID: mpro-x1384 / PDB: 5RFQ)
