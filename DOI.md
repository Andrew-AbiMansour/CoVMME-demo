### Published work
Any dataset that is either published or associated with published work that has a [Digital Object Identifier](https://www.doi.org) (DOI) should be included and stored under the "Papers" directory. 

e.g. Yang *et tal.* (2020): The crystal structure of COVID-19 main protease in complex with an inhibitor N3. BiorRxiv. Dataset. DOI: [0.1101/2020.02.26.964882](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.964882)

### Unpublished work
If your dataset does not have a DOI, you can generate one with:
- [EZID](https://ezid.cdlib.org): creates identifiers for any kind of entity including physical, digital (images, data, text, etc.), abstracts, etc. EZID provides pointers to objects (e.g. datasets) stored on the web.

  * e.g. MolSSI (2020): CoVMME-demo. Github. Dataset. DOI: [10.5072/FK2X63KR95](https://doi.org/10.5072/FK2X63KR95)
  
- [ResearchGate](https://explore.researchgate.net/display/support/ResearchGate+DOIs):
