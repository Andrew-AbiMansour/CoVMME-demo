## Citations

### Published work
Any dataset that is either published or associated with published work that has a [Digital Object Identifier](https://www.doi.org) (DOI) should be included and stored under the "Papers" directory. 

The format style to use:
  Author (2020): Title. Publisher. Dataset. DOI: link_to_doi

  **Example**: Yang *et tal.* (2020): The crystal structure of COVID-19 main protease in complex with an inhibitor N3. BiorRxiv. Dataset. DOI: [0.1101/2020.02.26.964882](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.964882)

### Unpublished work
If your dataset does not have a DOI, you can generate one with:

- [Figshare](https://figshare.com):  online open access repository where researchers can preserve and share their research outputs, including figures, datasets, etc. It is free to upload content and free to access, in adherence to the principle of open data. To publish your dataset, please follow the instructions below:

   * Create an [account](https://figshare.com/account/register), confirm your registration (via email), and then login with your credentials.
   * Go to the home [page](https://figshare.com/account/home#/data).
   * If your dataset is hosted on github, click on "Import from Github" and select the relevant repoistory.
   * If your dataset is not hosted on github, click on "Create a new item", and fill in the fields. If your datasets are hosted elsewhere, select the "Metadata record only"; otherwise, upload your files by clicking on the upload/drag file(s) button and upload your files. 
   * Once you're done with filling all the fields, **make sure to click on "Reserve Digital Object Identifier"**. This should produce a DOI link e.g. 10.6084/m9.figshare.12089361
   * Select "Publish" in the bottom menu, and click on "save changes".

  **Example**: MolSSI (2020): CoVMME-demo. Github. Dataset. DOI: [10.6084/m9.figshare.12089292](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12089292)
  
- [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org): general-purpose open-access repository that provides data storage and DOI generation. To publish your dataset, please follow the instructions below:
    * Create an [account](https://zenodo.org/signup), confirm your registration (via email), and then login with your credentials.
    * Click on [New upload](https://zenodo.org/deposit/new?c=covid-19) for the "coronavirus disease research community - COVID-19".
    * Drag and drop files to upload to zenodo, and complete the fields by filling the required information.
    * **Make sure to click on "Reserve DOI" under the "Basic Information" section**. This should produce a DOI link e.g. 10.5281/zenodo.3742380
    * Click on "Save" and then "Publish".

  **Example**: Aragao *et tal.* (2020): Raw diffraction data for structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease with PCM-0102179 (ID: mpro-x1384 / PDB: 5RFQ)
. Zenodo. Dataset. DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.3731504](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3731504)

- [Dryad](https://datadryad.org): general-purpose open-access repository that provides data storage and DOI generation. **Size limits: 10 GB of new files per version may be uploaded from your computer or 300 GB in total by URL or submitting multiple versions**. To publish your dataset, please follow the instructions below:
    * Create an ORCID [account](https://orcid.org/register) if you don't have one.
    * Login to [DRYAD](https://datadryad.org/stash/sessions/choose_login) with your ORCID credentials.
    * Click on "Start New Dataset" and select "other or not applicable" in the "Preliminary Information"
    * Complete the required info and then click on "Proceed to Upload".
    * Either upload your files or enter URLs of file locations, then click on "Proceed to Review" at the bottom page.
    * You should observe a generated DOI link e.g. 10.5061/dryad.2jm63xskr

  **Example**: Andrew Abi-Mansour (2020). Some_title. Dryad. Dataset. DOI: [10.5061/dryad.2jm63xskr]https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2jm63xskr
